# Internal Notes (Not Published)

This folder centralizes internal-only documents that were previously in the repo root. Public consumers should rely on `README.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` + guides referenced in README.

Moved here:
- REBUILD_SUMMARY.md (historical rebuild details)
- INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md (integration narrative)

Retained at root (public):
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- PACKAGE-CONSUMPTION-GUIDE.md
- FONT-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md (linked from README)

You can safely delete these internal summaries later or keep for team context.
